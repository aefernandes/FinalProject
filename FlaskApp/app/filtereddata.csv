This is an extension of the more standard setting of multivariate statistical analysis, in which the variables are dependent, but the observations are viewed as being independent.  The primary motivation for treating the data as a single high-dimensional sample is the potential for increased power when estimating parameters that are sensitive to relationships among the experimental units.  Recent advances in high-dimensional non-asymptotic theory, convex analysis, and algorithms allow such models to be fit to the very large data sets that arise in critical scientific areas such as genomics and neuroscience.  A major goal of this project is to assess the extent to which accounting for relationships among samples allows more accurate estimates to be made of relationships among variables.  An example of how this might be applied is in the assessment of associations between rare genetic variants and a phenotype.  The Sequential Kernel Association Test (SKAT) uses a kernel matrix which is essentially a covariance matrix of the genetic features.  The investigators will evaluate the use of the covariance matrix obtained from the recently-proposed Gemini approach to matrix-variate analysis as a kernel for the SKAT procedure. Three scientific applications have been identified to which the Gemini framework may be usefully extended.  In addition to conceptual and algorithmic challenges, these applications require the theory and methodology for the Gemini estimators to cover new settings, for example, due to SNP genotypes being highly non-Gaussian, and due to brain connectivity graphs changing over time.  The investigators will adapt the baseline Gemini models and algorithms to these new settings, and study their statistical and computational properties.<br/><br/>Recent technological breakthroughs in instrumentation allow large and detailed data sets describing living systems to be efficiently collected.  Researchers in biology and health science have embraced these technologies, but have sometimes been frustrated by the fact that such data must be interpreted conservatively, to guard against making non-reproducible claims.  Research progress would be accelerated if it were possible to analyze such data in a way that provides more statistical power, without expensive increases in the sample size.  One path to doing this is to move beyond the paradigm of treating the observed units in a study (e.g. human research subjects or laboratory animals) independently.  The investigator and his colleagues have developed a new type of statistical procedure that uses inferred relationships among the units of observation to more accurately estimate physical and biological unknowns.  They plan to develop the theory behind their technique, to develop software for carrying out the analyses, and to work with scientists in cancer biology, genomics, and neuroscience to assess the potential for using this approach to obtain novel scientific insights.  The project will focus on three scientific problems: identification of DNA lesions involved with cancer incidence and progression, identification of inherited genetic variants associated with human diseases, and characterization of neural connectivity changes induced by changes in consciousness state.","=""47.049""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Kerby A Shedden,"=""08/01/2013""",Ann Arbor,Andrew D.

The project will extend existing proof of concept components, explore alternative solutions for technical challenges, and integrate the components into a pilot GNA.  The GNA capitalizes on Linnaeus' system of Latin scientific names for organisms, a system that has endured as one of the oldest and most universal standards in science.  Virtually all information in biology is given context by evolution and the hierarchical pattern of shared similarities it has produced.  Scientists name species and change them with growing knowledge about their evolution and relationships.  These changes create a tangled network of synonyms that, along with homonyms and variant spellings, make it difficult to manage information effectively The GNA will create a system that enables us to translate names correctly across the literature and on-line datasets.  While the GNA has implications for the long-term management of information in the life sciences, the initial beneficiaries will be the more than 10,000 taxonomists worldwide, on whose expertise our understanding of the world's biodiversity rests.  A scientific name 'usage bank' coupled with the Biodiversity Heritage Library's CiteBank will generate shared indexes and access keys to the taxonomic literature, the source of most of our knowledge about nearly 2 million species. New nomenclatural registries founded by the co-operation of the Index Fungorum and the International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature's ZooBank will broadcast new discoveries as they are registered.  Other tools will help taxonomists collaborate to build authoritative catalogs of the Earth?s biodiversity, then merge and integrate them, a process that GNA will transform into a semantic cyberinfrastructure that will organize the growing, internet-accessible, knowledge of Earth's biosphere.  Ultimately, other NSF grantees in the life sciences should be able to augment their Data Management Plans by exposing their web sites to services that will create taxonomic indices.

The two major ingredients underlying the research are a distance-based procedure across multiple dimensions and a tilting/weighting-based importance measure for any specific dimension. The distance-based methods, e.g., the multi-response permutation procedure and the distance covariance, provide the ability to handle data even if the number of dimensions is larger than the sample size.  The tilting/weighting-based procedures allow variable importance to be evaluated for any dimension in the presence of any number of other variables. Thus, variable importance is evaluated in the multivariate context rather than on univariate marginal distributions.  In addition, the new methods will allow the number of selected variables to exceed the sample size; allow forward selection, backward selection, and sparse penalized weighting; minimize perturbation to the dependence structures actually present in the data; require minimal structural assumptions; and be sensitive to a wide range of multivariate dependencies, including some difficult or even impossible to detect with existing methods.<br/><br/>The methods developed as part of this project have a wide range of applications in biomedical and agricultural industries.  Modern genomics tools allow researchers to simultaneously measure thousands of variables that contain information about DNA, RNA, and protein characteristics of organisms.  The high-dimensional data generated by these modern high-throughput technologies must be mined to identify the variables that are most associated with health outcomes or other important traits.  Uncovering of such associations is crucial in a variety of areas including drug discovery, genetic risk analysis, personalized medicine, and plant and animal breeding. This research project will provide tools to help make these discoveries possible.  Reliable software implementations of the new methods will be created, maintained, archived in public repositories, and freely disseminated to genomics researchers and industry practitioners working with a diverse range of organisms and different high-throughput technologies.

Although physical methods for gene transfer (e.g., electroporation) have demonstrated improved (over conventional chemical-mediated techniques) treatment outcomes in difficult-to-transfect primary and stem cells, control and uniformity of treatment remain inadequate. Further, incremental improvements in performance of cuvette-based electroporation systems have only been realized through corresponding increases in system complexity and cost. One-by-one ejection of cells through cell-sized orifices has been found to promote cell membrane poration and DNA delivery into cells by imposing an identical and carefully controlled electromechanical environment on each individual cell. Unfortunately, a relatively high material cost and limitations on achievable treatment conditions (due to constraints on the geometry of microarrays manufactured using standard silicon micromachining techniques), inhibit practical implementation of existing silicon-based microarrays. The innovative design and optimization of the polymer microarray under this STTR Phase I project will yield a low-cost system capable of generating the mechanical stress field needed to achieve improved treatment outcomes in difficult-to-transfect cells.<br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable effective and economical transfection of difficult-to-transfect primary and stem cells used for a variety of research and therapeutic applications in the Life Sciences.

It is just this biological information that is the key to the biological functions. It is also at the heart of the conceptual basis of what we call systems biology. Much of the conceptual structure of systems biology can be built around the fundamental ideas concerning the storage transmission and use of biological information. Biological information resides, of course, in digital sequences in molecules like DNA and RNA, but also in 3-dimensional structures, chemical modifications, chemical activities, both of small molecules and enzymes, and in other components and properties of biological systems at many levels. The information depends critically on how each unit interacts with, and is related to, other components of the system. Biological information is therefore inherently context-dependent, which raises significant issues concerning its quantitative measure and representation. An important and immediate issue for the effective theoretical treatment of biological systems then is: how can context-dependent information be usefully represented and measured? This is important both to the understanding of the storage and flow of information that occurs in the functioning of biological systems and in evolution. This work involves both new ideas and the integration of new ideas. It represents new mathematical methods as well as a novel integration of approaches that are focused on the very real and practical problems of biological data analysis.

New interaction distance measures are considered with a new way of dealing with especially large data sets, especially the maximal information coefficient, for which a general approach may be possible, certainly for a small number of variables, and possibly in the general case. The ideas will be tested on a number of diverse biological data sets, especially around gene expressions, and other variants.

Zdilla of Temple University on the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II that is nature's solution to the most energetically taxing component of solar water splitting. This catalyst is a manganese-calcium-oxo cluster which undergoes structural rearrangements via a 5-stage catalytic cycle whereby it oxidizes water to oxygen, pumps protons across the thylakoid membrane, and harvests reducing equivalents for energy storage in sugars. In this area there is relatively extensive model chemistry of manganese clusters but the rearrangement chemistry and cluster flexibility, key components to the action of the OEC, are not well represented in the literature. Prof Zdilla's research program has two main foci: 1) the design and preparation of manganese clusters of enhanced flexibility via the avoidance of stabilizing chelating ligands, which lock cluster cores in place, and 2) study of reaction and rearrangement chemistry of these systems, especially in comparison to the well-established, more stable chelate clusters. <br/><br/>Global energy demand continues to grow exponentially while fossil fuel reserves continue to be depleted.

However, the benefits to an introduced species of release from enemies may depend on the levels of resources such as soil nutrients in the new habitat. In more fertile habitats, many plants grow more rapidly and lower their chemical or physical defenses against enemies. This should increase the advantage of the absence of enemies and thus the ability of introduced plants to outcompete native ones.

Yet despite many long-term and integrative studies, a detailed understanding of climatic impacts on upwelling and biological processes is still lacking, compromising our abilities to assess important concepts such as ecosystem ""health"" and ""resilience"".  To address these issues in the central-northern CCE, we have recently collated and analyzed records of rockfish and salmon growth and seabird reproductive success with respect to upwelling variability (NSF award #0929017).  These diverse, multi-decadal indicators revealed the importance of wintertime upwelling on ecosystem structure and function, even though upwelling, a principal driver of productivity in the CCE, is largely a summertime process.  This research led to an unexpected discovery that winter and summer upwelling vary independently of one another in distinct seasonal ""modes"", with some biological processes affected by the winter mode and others affected by the summer mode.  This is of significance because the summer mode shows a long-term increase (despite inter-decadal variability) while the winter mode does not.   In this current project, we have tested the overarching hypothesis that upwelling modes are forced by contrasting atmospheric-oceanographic processes, exhibit contrasting patterns of low- and high-frequency variability, and will be differentially impacted by global climate change with corresponding impacts on biology.  To address this hypothesis, we take a three-tiered approach:  Employ a suite of temperature and wind data to better describe seasonal CCE climate modes, then compile a broad dataset of growth, survival, and recruitment data to better establish their biological importance. Demonstrate that the same broad-scale atmospheric conditions that drive wintertime upwelling also drive wintertime precipitation in coastal forests, then use tree-ring data to hind-cast wintertime climate over the past several centuries to describe historical ranges of variability.  Derive a more mechanistic understanding of seasonal upwelling modes and use this information in combination with global climate models to project upwelling responses under various climate-change scenarios.    Outcomes for each of these objectives are:  Multivariate indicators of upwelling and species? responses were developed using wind and sea surface temperature (SST) data as well as growth and reproductive data for 11 species of fish and seabirds.  From previous work, we predicted that winds and SST from nearshore buoys could be decomposed into winter and spring/summer ?modes? of variability, but only a single mode of ""winter/spring"" environmental variability was observed.  We attribute this difference from expectations to the local and shorter-term measurements of winds and SST used in this study.  Most species responded to winds and SST variability similarly, but SST was a better predictor of most biological responses.   We found that broad-scale, wintertime high pressure systems over the northeast Pacific synchronize growth in marine and terrestrial ecosystems by affecting upwelling intensity in the ocean and precipitation over land.  Thus, tree-ring data could be used to hind-cast wintertime climate over the past six centuries.  In so doing, we find that the climate pattern is dominated by high-frequency variability, but that the 20th century is characterized by unusually strong climate anomalies that can severely reduce CCE productivity.   Three approaches were taken to address Goal 3: We analyzed atmospheric pressure data in each of the world?s major coastal upwelling zones and show that variability in upwelling-favorable winds is dominated by oceanic high pressure systems (OH), particularly in winter, and only weakly influenced by continental thermal low systems during the summer.  This work underscores the importance of OH systems to upwelling winds.  In a meta-analysis of the published literature, we find that upwelling-favorable winds have significantly intensified in four out of five coastal upwelling zones.  The strongest intensification signals occurred during the warm season and at higher latitudes, consistent with patterns of global warming.   We analyze output from general circulation models, which suggest that projected changes in the magnitude of upwelling over the next century are relatively weak.  However, the various models indicate a decline in summertime upwelling-favorable winds, especially in the southern CCE. We suspect that these changes are related to the poleward migrations of major atmospheric pressure cells that drive upwelling winds.      Overall, this study used observational records to investigate atmospheric forcing mechanisms for the winter and summer climate modes as well as establish biological response, hind-cast the winter mode using tree-ring data to asses historical ranges of variability and use coupled atmosphere-ocean global circulation models to project the potential future of upwelling and its biological consequences.  In so doing, we have published 4 peer-reviewed papers, provided 18 talks at scientific conferences or research centers, taught 2 workshops, and trained two undergraduate interns and a post-doctoral researcher in ""ecosystem oceanography.""

Yet, despite many long-term and integrative studies, a detailed understanding of climatic impacts on upwelling and biological processes is still lacking, compromising our abilities to assess important concepts such as ecosystem ""health"" and ""resilience."" To address these issues in the central-northern CCE, the PIs have recently collated and analyzed records of rockfish and salmon growth and seabird reproductive success with respect to upwelling variability (NSF award #0929017). These diverse, multi-decadal time series revealed the importance of wintertime upwelling on ecosystem structure and function, even though upwelling, a principal driver of productivity in the CCE, is largely a summertime process. This research led to an unexpected discovery that winter and summer upwelling vary independently of one another in distinct seasonal ""modes"", with some biological processes affected by the winter mode and others by the summer mode. This is of significance because the summer mode shows a long-term increase (despite inter-decadal variability) while the winter mode does not. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:  In this new project, the PIs will test the overarching hypothesis that upwelling modes are forced by contrasting atmospheric-oceanographic processes, exhibit contrasting patterns of low- and high-frequency variability, and will be differentially impacted by global climate change with corresponding impacts on biology. To address this hypothesis the PIs propose a three-tiered approach to better understand seasonal upwelling modes and their differential impacts on biology of the CCE. First, they will examine the responses of an entirely new suite of species to upwelling modes, including Pacific sardine (recruitment), black rockfish (growth), rhinoceros auklet and Brandt's cormorant (survival), and coho salmon (survival). Previously, coarsely resolved upwelling indices were used in these analyses, but the PIs now will integrate winds and temperatures from local buoy data to better capture climate variability on finer timescales. Second, they will derive a more mechanistic understanding of seasonal upwelling modes and use this information in combination with global climate models to forecast upwelling responses under various climate-change scenarios. Third, preliminary results indicate that tree-ring data co-vary with the fish and seabirds and are similarly sensitive to a driver of winter upwelling, the Northern Oscillation Index (NOI).  The PIs will use tree-ring data to provide a 300-400 year reconstruction of the winter NOI to assess the historical range of variability in upwelling mean and variance. This study will reveal the past, present forcing, and potential future of upwelling and its biological consequences in the California Current.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This study will explore the history, future, and biological impacts of independent, seasonal climate modes and their impacts on key species. In so doing, the PIs will develop an understanding of coupled climate-ecosystem change that will be contributed to state, national, and international policy-makers, including the California Cooperative Climate Adaptation Team (CO-CAT)and the IPCC Assessment Report 5. The PIs will develop and test biological and physical indicators of California Current ecosystem productivity and will make this information available for management, specifically fisheries stock and integrated ecosystem assessments. The project will provide cross-training for 2 post-doctoral research associates, 2 other young scientists, and 1 undergraduate in physical oceanography, marine ecology, quantitative skills, communication, as well as the business of science, such as project and fiscal management and fund-raising.","=""47.050""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Bryan A Black,"=""11/01/2012""",Austin,David L.

The proper use of multiple sources of information, or multiple sensors, ensures high sensitivity of the detection procedure. However, multiple streams of diverse information can cause false alarms. What are the optimal statistical techniques of combining mixed types of data to yield a quick and error-free detection? Proposed statistical methods deal with potential threats by detecting heterogeneities and anomalies and locating change points in the distribution of multidimensional data. It is assumed that a number of sensors simultaneously collect and report data sequences. When a significant event occurs and a potential threat appears, the distribution of one or several sequences changes. The goal is to detect a threat as soon as possible, subject to a low rate of false alarms. Derivation of optimal threat detection algorithms on multiple sequences will be based on the recently developed theory and methodology of multiple comparisons in sequential experiments. These new techniques introduced by the PI and his student led to tests of multiple hypotheses that control both the familywise error rate and the familywise power at a low expected sampling cost. This suggests several approaches to the quick multi-sensor change-point detection. Analogues of CUSUM, Bayesian, and asymptotically pointwise optimal change-point detection tools will be developed based on the new methodology in order to control the probability of a false alarm, the missed discovery rate, and to minimize the mean detection delay under these constraints. <br/><br/>Quick detection of threats by discovering changes in distributions, patterns, and trends is one of the most vital problems in quality control, market analysis, epidemiology, climatology, target tracking, and other fields. Among wide areas of application, this project particularly focuses on detecting breaches in cyber security and biological threats such as epidemics and bioterrorist attacks. The project will provide general tools for the prompt reaction to threatening anomalies in real situations such as (i) recognizing a pre-epidemic pattern and signalling an epidemic threat based on geospatial public health surveillance data in different regions, (ii) detecting computer threats and breaches in cyber security, based on multiple data streams, and (iii) detecting potential threats from extual analysis of communication networks. An important modern application of change-point detection on multiple data streams appears in DNA sequencing. The possibility of utilizing the prior information in sequential change-point analysis of multiple data streams opens doors for wide applications. It will allow to predict threats and make forecasts for a number of processes that exhibit a two-phase or multi-phase behavior, such as the epidemics and inter-epidemic periods, economic growth and recession, and spikes in energy prices. Developed methods of fast change-point detection will be used for the early detection of unknown targets and intrusions, fraud activity, unusual behavior at vital locations, detection and classification of pre-epidemic trends, and also, for the prevention of epidemics and terrorist attacks.","=""47.049""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Michael I Baron,"=""10/01/2013""",Richardson,Leland M.

Evidence of microbial activity in the form of sulfur isotope signatures in sulfide minerals has been reported in many peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems along mid-ocean ridges on the ocean floor and in analogous ancient systems (e.g., outcropping as ophiolite sequences on continents). Recent studies further suggest that biological activity plays a significant role in the long-term storage of sulfur and carbon within serpentinites with a potentially far-reaching impact on the global sulfur and carbon cycles. That said, controls on biological activity in peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems, whether on land or under the sea, have not yet been conclusively proven and hence the impact of microbial activity on seafloor geochemical cycles remains unknown. This research will characterize the factors that control microbial activity within serpentinites. Determination of the coupling between biological activity and both temperature and fluid chemistry during serpentinization will be assessed via a novel combination of geochemical techniques that will indicate how these key parameters evolve through time.  Specifically, multiple sulfur isotope (32S, 33S, 34S) analyses of bulk sulfides occurring in the serpentinites and additional, targeted, in-situ, sulfide/sulfate isotope measurements will be used to detect the presence of microbial activity.  These data will be combined with detailed petrological and mineralogical examination and in-situ isotope analyses of host mineral phases. Serpentinites from three different tectonic settings and basic mineralogies will be examined: (1) the continental Iberian Margin, (2) the 15?20"" N fracture zone along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and (3) serpentinites from an ophiolite sequence in the Northern Apennine, Italy.  the first two were drilled as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).  Research goals will be to determinee how variable fluid compositions and temperatures affect the occurrence of biological activity. This knowledge will provide new insights and constraints on the limits of life on Earth and how sulfur is cycled through altered oceanic crust, as well as how global geochemical cycles and the chemical exchange occur between different Earth reservoirs. Broader impacts of the project involve the support of two early career scientists, both of whom will be trained in the use of new cutting-edge techniques, foster collaboration between Virginia Tech and Harvard University, and engage two undergraduate students in the science.","=""47.050""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Esther M Schwarzenbach,"=""08/01/2013""",Blacksburg,Barbara L.
