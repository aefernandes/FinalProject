Over its long history, which stretches back more than half a century to the dawn of computation, computational chemistry has achieved a much-deserved status as a full partner with experiment in scientific discovery, yielding simulations of such high accuracy that its predictions of a variety of molecular properties may be considered ""computational experiments,"" often with greater reliability than laboratory measurements for many chemical properties.<br/><br/>The history of computational chemistry endows the field not only with great experience, but also with a legacy of diverse and complex code stacks.  Many molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry programs involve hundreds of thousands to even a million lines of hand-written code in a variety of languages, including Fortran-77, Fortran-90, C, and C++.  While this complexity has arisen naturally from the intricacy of the problems these programs were designed to solve, it also presents a crucial obstacle to the long-term sustainability and extension of the software on ever-changing high-performance computing hardware.<br/><br/>The goal of the S2I2C2M2 will be to overcome these obstacles of both algorithms and culture and change the fundamental nature of computational chemistry software development.  In the year-long Conceptualization Phase, S2I2C2M2 will bring together an interdisciplinary team of computational chemists, computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and computer engineers to attack the fundamental problems of software complexity and education.  Three working groups will focus on the key areas of portable parallel infrastructure, general-purpose tensor algebra algorithms, and protocols for information exchange and code interoperability.

Professor Dong's group uses a transition metal catalyzed enamine-mediated carbon-hydrogen (C-H) functionalization strategy to transform simple, unactivated olefins.  This new reaction offers a number of advantages over the classical ketone-akylation methods, including the substitution of expensive or toxic halide reactants with more environmentally benign and less costly olefins, the use of neutral catalytic conditions rather than stoichiometric amounts of strong bases, and the development of a by-product free process. Professor Dong is actively engaged in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) IMPACT Program for undergraduate mentoring, the Welch Summer Scholar Program for high school student training, and the ""Shadow a Scientist"" program for the early education of middle school and  home-schooled students.

The added synergistic benefit of enhanced capabilities on campus will also increase competitiveness for external funding, further facilitating and enhancing undergraduate research experiences. Undergraduate researchers will travel to high-needs school districts to share their experiences with high school students. Their authentic narratives of scientific inquiry will inspire future scientists as to the leading-edge research one can do as a college student. Ultimately, the goal of these high school connections is to enhance the diversity of students entering science and technology fields.","=""47.049""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Jeffrey Werner,"=""09/15/2013""",Cortland,Carlos A.

The three-year project involves faculty and students in electrical engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln and in chemistry at University of Massachusetts Boston. The study is examining two courses in each discipline (that typically occur in the sophomore and junior years) for evidence of an abstraction threshold - the gap in reasoning ability that can be crossed by students. The project is seeking to characterize reasoning applied to problem solving using a cognitive processing model, Representation Mapping.<br/><br/>The study tests two hypotheses: <br/>1) Many students do not have fully mature processes for abstraction, i.e., cognitive supply, and it is possible to measure what their processes are and the degree to which they are capable of reasoning using abstraction. <br/>2) Somewhere in each undergraduate STEM curriculum, cognitive demand increases to the point where a typical students current capacity for abstraction is not matched to the complexity of problems posed, and this impacts student performance. <br/><br/>The research questions being studied are: <br/>RQ1: How can students problem solving processes and degree of abstraction in two different STEM disciplines - electrical engineering and chemistry - be characterized using Representation Mapping? <br/>RQ2: What evidence is there that abstraction thresholds exist in undergraduate electrical engineering and chemistry curricula? <br/>RQ3: What are discipline-specific nuances of abstraction in electrical engineering and chemistry education?<br/><br/>This theory-driven project involves a rigorous interdisciplinary study that has the potential to significantly advance the understanding of how students reason when solving problems associated with deep concepts in STEM disciplines. The effort is in direct alignment the report from the National Academies on Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER), which includes ""Interdisciplinary studies of cross-cutting concepts and cognitive processes"" as one of its four overall recommendations for promising directions in studying undergraduate STEM education. The project is making significant contributions to the knowledge base on how to increase students' problem solving approaches and is helping to uncover how domain-general and discipline-dependent cognitive processing interact in two STEM disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE <br/>As manifest by its strong alignment with the DBER report, the project is an area of national interest. The project is uncovering commonalities of abstraction in two STEM disciplines and clarifying differences in abstraction between the disciplines. This effort is providing fundamental insights to support how instructors can capitalize on commonalities and deliberately provide avenues for students to practice discipline-dependent reasoning strategies in problem solving. <br/><br/>Situating the data collection in two very different universities - a traditional research university in the Midwest and a majority minority non-traditional university in the Northeast - lends greater potential relevance to the findings, which is being widely disseminated at high profile conferences in both science and engineering education. An interdisciplinary study is producing results that are more readily transferred to other STEM disciplines, thus enhancing their potential for broad adoption.","=""47.076""",490106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"=""4900""",Hannah Sevian,"=""09/01/2013""",Dorchester,Edith Gummer,,US,"=""08""",,egummer@nsf.gov,University of Massachusetts Boston,"=""09/03/2013""",,"=""808008122""",(617) 287-7724

This IRES takes a non-traditional approach by connecting U.S. students with undergraduate research experiences throughout Germany while reciprocally, at no cost to the U.S. funding agencies, German students will be placed into summer U.S. Chemistry and Materials Science sites. For 2014-2016, through a partnership with the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) students will conduct summer research on important topics at leading German universities and institutes, all offering substantial research projects with a high potential for resulting publications. Eight U.S. students?from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds and from institutions with limited access to research?are recruited nationally to participate in this ten-week IRES program. Conversely, approximately eight international students from across Germany are placed throughout existing NSF sponsored Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs in the U.S., nurturing the global networks of these domestic programs. Participants in both directions are matched with research mentors and projects that meet their individual interests. All IRES participants present their research at the Spring ACS National Meeting; prepare an official abstract; create and present a research poster; consider ethical issues of research; gain respect for scientific professionalism, other cultures, and collaboration; and communicate scientific findings. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL Abstract<br/>Strict curricular requirements prevent many U.S. students majoring in the sciences from studying abroad. While sharpening their laboratory research skills, this intensive, summer International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides U.S. undergraduates with the opportunity to develop talents that will allow them to work effectively across cultures, boost their careers, and establish relationships that may lead to future scientific collaborations. In particular, summer research allows students to gain international experience without disrupting their studies; increases national competiveness, innovation, and knowledge base; and assists in solving challenges of a global scope (e.g., energy, health, food/water). This American Chemical Society (ACS) IRES program funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) yearly connects eight U.S. chemistry and materials science students?recruited national from diverse backgrounds and institutions?with research experiences at recognized producers of scientific knowledge throughout Germany by means of a partnership with the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). While fostering intellectual growth and maturity, the IRES experience is intended to catalyze students? desire to enroll in advanced degree programs; deliver a substantial research experience; produce excellent scientific publications; instill a respect for other cultures and science professionalism; and provide an appreciation for the global scientific enterprise. Reciprocally, as part of this program and at no cost to U.S. institutions or funders, approximately eight German students are matched to and placed at domestic NSF sponsored summer institutes to nurture international dimensions and establish additional networks at these host universities. This unique many-to-many model where students from all U.S. institutions can go to all German institutions, and students from across Germany can go to dozens of U.S. partner institutions, significantly disperses the beneficial impact of these international exchanges beyond what is achievable with a traditional study abroad program.","=""47.080""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Steven R Meyers,"=""06/01/2013""",,Maija M Kukla,,US,"=""00""",Washington,mkukla@nsf.gov,American Chemical Society (ACS),"=""05/30/2013""",,"=""044760098""",(202) 872-6365

The isotopic composition of nitrate has been shown to contain information about the source of the nitrate (i.e. nitrogen oxides = NOx = NO+NO2) and the oxidation processes that convert NOx to nitrate in the atmosphere prior to deposition.

Previous experiments have produced scattered results partly because the nucleation mode was not well controlled and the methods used introduced artifacts.  These investigators plan to eliminate such problems by developing a new two-capillary instrument in which a single crystal nucleates and grows at the tip of an ultra-thin pure-silica glass capillary within a small growth chamber that can be isolated from the vapor source.  The presence of two well-separated crystals held under identical isothermal conditions will allow precise observation of the deposition and sublimation processes.  Advantages of this approach over previous methods (e.g., diffusion chambers, substrate chambers, and electrodynamic balances) include greater control over the thermodynamic conditions and the ability to characterize potential crystal-crystal and crystal-substrate interactions.  Experiments in the new twin-capillary chamber will be made for a range of air pressures and temperatures, including conditions relevant to cirrus formation, as well as for multiple nucleation modes.  By nucleating the initial crystal in different ways, these investigators expect to determine how much of the previously observed scatter in crystal habits arose from variations in nucleation mode.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research rests on development of more precise, artifact-free data describing crystal shape (""habit"") development and deposition coefficient functions as a function of environmental conditions.  These results will allow improved evaluation of current crystal growth models.  Broader impacts will accrue through training of a graduate student in techniques of new-instrument design and data analysis and through dissemination of results via multidisciplinary conferences and scientific journals.

Although NO signaling mechanisms are largely unknown, it has been found that iron-sulfur proteins are one of the main reaction targets for NO, wherein [Fe-S] clusters become modified and convert to DNICs. In this study, the following specific questions will be probed: What are the intrinsic properties and reactivity of DNICs? What are the physiological and/or deleterious roles of DNICs? What happens to the bridging sulfides when [Fe-S] clusters are degraded by NO? How do cells cope with unwanted [Fe-S] modifications by NO?  These questions will be addressed by employing synthetic chemistry expertise in combination with a number of spectroscopic, biochemical, bioanalytical and mechanistic studies. <br/><br/>Nitric oxide (NO) is a double-edged sword in biology.  While NO is a ubiquitous signaling molecule, misregulation of NO is implicated in numerous conditions including vascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegeneration. The proposed studies will elucidate the interconnections among the key cellular redox components such as [Fe-S] clusters, NO, O2, H2S, and thiols, which will provide fresh insights and solutions to current questions in the field and may lead to new paradigms in the study of biological NO signaling.  This project will also be integrated into educational and outreach activities, which will initiate (i) a program dedicated to develop inquiry-based laboratory curricula for high school chemistry and (ii) a student-led problem solving session at a major research conference to promote a culture of active participation from students and underrepresented groups in science.","=""47.049""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Eunsuk Kim,"=""02/15/2013""",Providence,Colby A.

However, the underlying chemical kinetics and rate limiting steps in LTC have not been directly explored because of an inability to measure the key chemical constituents, hydroperoxy (HO2) and alkylperoxy (RO2) radicals, that control the process.  In this study, a new laser absorption diagnostic combining two more traditional techniques will be employed to overcome this measurement problem and allow direct measurement of these peroxy radicals at preignition conditions, with the goal of developing a fundamental understanding of the underlying chemistry.  The new diagnostic, cavity enhanced magneto-optical rotation (CEMOR), combines cavity enhanced ringdown spectroscopy which provides the sensitivity to measure the radicals and magneto-optic rotation which provides the selectivity necessary to eliminate interference from other compounds with similar absorption characteristics.  This work will aid in the design of the next generation engine systems with increased efficiency and reduced emissions.  The broader impact of the work will include training students in combustion science and state-of-the-art optical diagnostics techniques.

Current research suggests that eumelanin is formed from the self-assembly of dihydroxyindole oligomers and nanoparticles.  Well-defined dihydroxyindole oligomers will be synthesized via iterative Suzuki coupling routes, and the self-assembly of these oligomers, their oxidation products, and metal ions will be studied using techniques such as NMR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Structure-activity relationships in the formation of micro- and nano- scale assemblies from well-defined oligomers will be sought to provide a molecular level understanding of eumelanin structure.  In the long term, understanding the chemical and photophysical properties of eumelanin is an important goal given its incompletely defined biological functions and potential role in pathologies. <br/><br/>Despite public interest in melanin, its complexity and heterogeneity have provided obtacles to its study.  Melanin is certainly a biopolymer with an important role in human biology, with particular significance in the biology of the skin and hair and a likely connection to pathologies such as skin cancer.  A greater understanding of the chemistry of melanins would help illuminate their roles in human biology and disease, as well as in melanin-based materials for engineering, environmental, and biological applications. However, a fundamental understanding of melanins lags far behind other biopolymers, such as proteins and DNA.  Here, the Beltisky group will use synthetic model compounds in a ""bottom-up"" approach toward the understanding of the formation and structure of eumelanin. As has been the case in the Belitsky group, undergraduate researchers will form the backbone of the research team.

On the other hand, in near-shore environments, these projections are much more difficult because the CO2 chemistry is largely modified by biogeochemical processes operating on timescales of hours to months.  To make predictions on how near-shore seawater CO2 chemistry will change in response to ocean acidification (OA), it is critical to consider the relative influence of net ecosystem production (NEP) and net ecosystem calcification (NEC), and how these processes might change in response to this major perturbation.  Understanding how future OA will alter near-shore seawater CO2 chemistry and variability was identified as a major critical knowledge gap at the recent IPCC WG II/WG I workshop on impacts of ocean acidification on marine biology and ecosystems in January of 2011, and also at the International Ocean Acidification Network workshop in Seattle in June of 2012.  <br/><br/>With funding from this CAREER award, a researcher at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and his students will study how biogeochemical processes and the relative contributions from NEP and NEC modify seawater CO2 chemistry in near-shore environments influenced by different benthic communities under well characterized environmental and physical conditions, and how these processes might change in response to OA.

The project is expected to strengthen the knowledge base regarding student interpretation and manipulation of scientific representations and the affordances of visualization tools for teaching chemistry, as well as inform the design of new visualization-based science curricula.","=""47.076""","495176 H-1B FUND, EHR, NSF","=""4900""",Mike Stieff,"=""09/15/2013""",,Dawn Rickey,,US,"=""07""",,drickey@nsf.gov,University of Illinois at Chicago,"=""09/11/2013""",,"=""098987217""",(312) 996-4348

The course is being designed to be relevant to American Indians by including culturally rich examples and real-life applications. Possible topics include water and wastewater treatment, Missouri River water quality, organic farming, alternative energy, ethnobotany, honey bee colony collapse disorder, and Type 2 diabetes. These topics are being developed into case studies, the findings of which will be disseminated at faculty workshops and enrollment campaigns. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>American Indian students are underrepresented in all STEM fields. This proposal addresses an opportunity and a need to create an introductory chemistry course sequence at NICC, to be disseminated to other tribal colleges, including nearby Little Priest Tribal College (LPTC).  Science education studies have shown that science courses are made relevant to American Indian students through the inclusion of culturally rich examples. To do this for chemistry, the project team is developing case studies based on community topics, each of which is linked to specific laboratory methods or measurements. The laboratory experiences are modular for use in a variety of courses. This project advances and improves current STEM education practices at tribal colleges by developing a sustainable process that involves community engagement. Students learn how to connect topics of interest to the community to curricular materials by way of a partnership that involves community leaders, college faculty, college students, and community outreach. This facilitates student learning and deepens existing Native American student knowledge and engagement in STEM fields. The resulting materials and practices are applicable to all educators seeking to increase participation of underrepresented STEM groups.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This project promotes STEM learning by Native American students, as well as learning about chemistry instruction by studying these students? attitudes toward continued enrollment in chemistry courses.  The process for making deep connections between community-relevant topics and laboratory exercises shows how to connect the mission of community colleges to the sciences in a way that attracts and retains individuals from other underrepresented groups to STEM education - leading to more students pursuing higher education in STEM fields and a more diverse and stronger STEM workforce.

The materials attracted great interest in the energetic material community since they are characterized by a high energy and power density (superior to supercapacitors), and are low cost and safe, useful for micro-thermal sources, micro-actuators and enablers for environmentally clean primers, miniature safe detonators, in-situ welding and soldering, and also chemical neutralization agents.  Yet, interfaces play a critical role during the synthesis and the utilization of these reactive layered nanostructures. The formation of interfacial layers is not only poorly understood but uncontrolled at present. A fundamental understanding of the formation and role of these aluminum/metal-oxide interfacial layers would not only bring control of such systems, but also be transformative for fundamental and practical advances in this field. This project aims at developing an atomic-level understanding of the interface formation process between Aluminum/Metal-oxide by combining in-situ spectroscopy and imaging with Density Functional Theory calculations for a variety of deposition methods. To this end, model surfaces and atomically precise deposition methods (e.g. atomic layer deposition) will be used to derive detailed atomic information, in combination with nanopatterning processes to quantify the contribution of the interfacial layers for both the reaction kinetics and the stability at low temperatures. Deposition/synthesis issues specifically associated with highly reactive materials are unraveled by the development of novel theoretical methods coupled with extensive and unique in situ characterization methods.  Thermal characterization techniques combustion tests combined with high resolution imaging and x-ray diffraction will be used to quantitatively evaluate the role of such interfaces in operating conditions. This project constitutes a first step in understanding the role of interfaces in reactive hetero-structures. <br/>Aluminum, copper, iron and zinc are all widely available and recyclable resources and common materials in microelectronics. These Aluminum/metal oxide nanolaminates are therefore sustainable, totally safe and not toxic for the environment and human health, requiring no hazardous substances and releasing no pollutant chemicals for their productions. The social, environmental and economic benefits are clear since these nanomaterials and nanostructures will contribute to reducing the use of many dangerous and polluting energetic materials (containing lead salt for example or synthesized using polluting chemistry). <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Reactive materials are critical for defense and energy. Ultra-thin layers of reactive materials, called reactive composite nanolaminates (e.g. aluminum and copper oxide), have attracted great interest in the energetic material community since they are characterized by a high energy and power density and are low cost and safe, useful for miniature thermal sources, actuators, detonators, and chemical neutralization agents. Most investigations have focused on the relationship between the structure and thermal properties of these reactive and metastable nanolaminates. Yet, interfaces play a critical role during their synthesis and utilization. The nature of interfaces is not only poorly understood but uncontrolled at present. A fundamental understanding of the formation and role of these interfacial layers would not only bring control of such systems, but also be transformative for fundamental and practical advances in energy and defense fields.  By combining growth, characterization and theoretical studies, this project provides the foundation towards the design of future tailored reactive nanostructures by interface optimization using atomically precise technologies. It establishes a bridge between the fields of reactive materials and solid state and material chemistry. It provides a multidisciplinary environment for the students, besides the benefits of cultural exchange. There is a focused integration of the research topic into educational programs (graduate courses, tutorials, certificates) both in the US and in France. At UT Dallas, this project engages underrepresented minority and women graduate students, and is a backbone for targeted outreach within the greater Dallas area. It supports existing programs developed by the UT Dallas Office of Diversity and Community Engagement, and programs to mentor and engage undergraduates in research such as the Academic Bridge and the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation programs.","=""47.049""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Yves J Chabal,"=""09/15/2013""",Richardson,Lynnette D.

Based on recent modeling efforts, there is reason to believe that stress induced dissolution is also a significant deformation mechanism in cementitious materials.  Thus, there is an expected coupling between the evolution of chemistry, microstructure development, and stress and strain states within cementitious materials.  A primary objective of this project is to develop a fundamental thermodynamic model framework that links evolving system chemistry and mechanics of cementitious materials, and to implement the model through a computational method that predicts the fully coupled evolution of microstructure and viscoelastic/viscoplastic properties of the materials.  In synergy with the fundamental modeling, novel experiments using time-stepping micro-computed tomography of stressed specimens will be performed to test the hypothesis that stress induces dissolution in cementitious materials.  The results of this project will lead to important advances in understanding the evolution of constitutive properties and the underlying deformation mechanisms; this will ultimately help enable design of concrete with greater strength, toughness, durability, and sustainability. <br/><br/>Concrete, the second most used commodity in the world, suffers from many structural and durability issues that result in substantial economic and environmental costs.  The drawbacks of cementitious materials such as concrete may be attributed in part to design limitations associated with the lack of available modeling tools for effectively predicting the evolution of the material structure and properties.  The results of this project will provide societal benefit by providing advanced modeling, experimental, and computational tools to help improve the economy, durability and sustainability of cementitious materials.  Furthermore, other researchers will ultimately be able to freely implement the tools developed in this project to address a host of important issues with respect to concrete, such as degradation due to freeze-thaw cycling and chemical attack.  A modeling approach that involves fundamental theory and coupling between chemistry and mechanical processes (such as deformation) has the capability to ultimately transform our understanding of the behavior of cementitious materials such as concrete.","=""47.041""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Zachary Grasley,"=""06/01/2013""",Blacksburg,Yick Grace Hsuan,,US,"=""09""",Blacksburg,yhsuan@nsf.gov,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,"=""03/21/2013""",,"=""003137015""",(540) 231-3174

Prof. Vela and his students investigate new surface ligand doping strategies that enable to control the degree of functionalization or valency per nanocrystal. As part of this effort, Prof. Vela's group will investigate the changes in ligand organization, surface chemistry and nanocrystal properties that result from surface modification. Controlling the degree of functionalization per nanocrystal remains an unsolved challenge in colloidal semiconductors. Surface modification is routinely performed by ligand exchange with excess carboxylate- or amine-terminated thiols. However, this method fails to control the extent of surface modification. To solve this problem, Prof. Vela and his students will synthesize surface-doped quantum dots capped with chemically-active native ligands and characterize their surface microstructures, synthesize modular functional polydentate ligands for surface-doping and study their ligand exchange behavior with quantum dots, and explore the use of surface-doped quantum dots for lanthanide optical activation and rationing of rare earths. This research will positively impact our ability to fine-tune the number and relative configuration of energy- and charge-transfer donors and acceptors, providing unprecedented control over exciton decay pathways across the inorganic-organic-solvent interface.<br/><br/>Success of this research will result in powerful strategies to fabricate, assemble and discover functional nanomaterials for imaging, biology, energy and catalysis. For example, the extent of surface coverage by a particular functional group will impact a nanocrystal's surface affinity and permeability, and its ability to localize, penetrate, and be transported across biological tissues and subcellular structures. In addition, advanced characterization of surface-doped nanocrystals will further our understanding of surface-ligand organization and of how this affects optoelectronic properties. The educational goals of this proposal are to close gaps in nanotechnology research and education by introducing a university-wide nano seminar series and a nanochemistry course at Iowa State University, and to broaden participation via diverse recruiting and bilingual activities for Hispanic and Latino/a students and families. A weekly seminar and a formal course will promote interactions and facilitate exchanges among nanotechnology researchers across departments. By communicating science in two languages, Prof. Vela will directly address a growing demographic to raise awareness and advocacy for nanoscience as a way to improve the community, the national economy, and the environment.","=""47.049""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Javier Vela,"=""04/15/2013""",Ames,Zeev Rosenzweig,,US,"=""04""",Ames,zrosenzw@nsf.gov,Iowa State University,"=""04/08/2013""",,"=""005309844""",(515) 294-5536

Support is provided through an induction program to provide a seamless transition into the students' new teaching career in a high-needs Georgia school district. Previous Noyce projects at Kennesaw State University (KSU) have developed targeted recruitment plans for Masters of Arts in Teaching Chemistry and Physics Education since 2008.  These projects have highlighted the importance of developing strategic and deliberate recruitment efforts to attract highly competent chemistry and physics students who are close to, or have already graduated, into chemistry and physics certification programs.  These projects also provide a general framework for the development of recruitment plans that target other populations.  The Noyce project offers stipends to college-bound high school juniors and seniors and KSU freshman and sophomores who participate and lead a week-long science summer camp to engage in them in the science education community of practice and begin to build their teacher identity.  Once accepted into the education program, eligible students receive up to a 2-year scholarship to complete their certification coursework and field experiences.  This project is designed to engage students early on in educational experiences and keep them progressing at a rate that will allow them to graduate in four years.  The specific objectives of this project are to: 1). develop customized recruitment strategies to attract academically strong and culturally diverse students to the B.S. Chemistry and Physics Education program at KSU from these two sources, 2). offer stipends to high school students and KSU freshmen and sophomores who participate in a week-long science summer camp intended to build their teacher identity, 3). provide 25 2-year scholarships to students to participate in the B.S.

For the synthesis, the carbons will be infiltrated by polycarbosilanes until the pore space is filled. Heat-treatment of the so-infiltrated carbons will produce periodic mesostructured silicon carbide/carbon composite materials. Subsequently, these composites will be treated at high pressure and temperature to transform the carbon phase into periodic mesostructures of diamond. The synthesis will be performed in multi-anvil assemblies which allow for pressures of up to 27 GPa and temperatures above 2000?C. The produced mesostructured silicon carbide/diamond composites will be structurally characterized and tested for their mechanical properties. By selective removal of the silicon carbide phase from the SiC/diamond composites mesoporous forms of diamond will be produced. In addition, we will explore the mechanisms and kinetics of the phase transitions within mesostructures at high pressure by in-situ Raman, SAXS, and IR spectroscopic experiments. The in-situ experiments will be done in diamond anvil cells. It is expected that the realization of these aims will create seminal knowledge across the different fields of high-pressure science and periodic mesostructures, and produce potentially useful new materials. <br/><br/>NON TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Mesoporous materials belong to the most important classes of materials due to their wide structural diversity and broad range of applications including catalysis, separation, microelectronics, and drug-delivery. Pressure and temperatures are the two major thermodynamic variables in synthesis. The emphasis of this work is to explore the role of high pressure in synthesis to produce mesostructures of diamond and investigate the mechanisms of phase transformations at high-pressure inside a mesostructure. Thereby, the project will advance the understanding of the chemical high-pressure behavior of periodic mesostructures and make a broad impact on synthetic high-pressure chemistry which is currently an underrepresented field. Diamond is the arguably the most technologically important high-pressure phase. Mesostructured composites of diamond, which are the expected products in this research, could find applications as ultrahard materials. Diamond is known as biocompatible material and thus mesoporous forms of diamond could have potential in drug-delivery. Commercially relevant outcomes of the work will be communicated to industry via the Lehigh Nanotechnology Network and Lehigh's Industrial Liaison Program. Leading companies for the production of diamond materials will be involved in materials testing, which will catalyze technology transfer. The project will be done in collaboration between a degree-granting University (Lehigh University) and a non-degree granting research institution (Carnegie Institution of Washington) thereby building a close tie between these institutions. The involved students and post-docs will learn an unusual combination of synthetic (synthesis of mesostructured materials, high pressure syntheses) and analytical techniques (electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, gas sorption etc.).

Students can have difficulty understanding how two-dimensional (2D) drawings used in textbooks represent the real 3D structures. Also, concepts such as chirality, molecular interactions, steric hindrance, and energetic stability are inaccessible without a 3D understanding of molecules.

Based on recent modeling efforts, there is reason to believe that stress induced dissolution is also a significant deformation mechanism in cementitious materials. Thus, there is an expected coupling between the evolution of chemistry, microstructure development, and stress and strain states within cementitious materials. A primary objective of this project is to develop a fundamental thermodynamic model framework that links evolving system chemistry and mechanics of cementitious materials, and to implement the model through a computational method that predicts the fully coupled evolution of microstructure and viscoelastic/viscoplastic properties of the materials. In synergy with the fundamental modeling, novel experiments using time-stepping micro-computed tomography of stressed specimens will be performed to test the hypothesis that stress induces dissolution in cementitious materials. The results of this project will lead to important advances in understanding the evolution of constitutive properties and the underlying deformation mechanisms; this will ultimately help enable design of concrete with greater strength, toughness, durability, and sustainability. <br/><br/>Concrete, the second most used commodity in the world, suffers from many structural and durability issues that result in substantial economic and environmental costs. The drawbacks of cementitious materials such as concrete may be attributed in part to design limitations associated with the lack of available modeling tools for effectively predicting the evolution of the material structure and properties. The results of this project will provide societal benefit by providing advanced modeling, experimental, and computational tools to help improve the economy, durability and sustainability of cementitious materials. Furthermore, other researchers will ultimately be able to freely implement the tools developed in this project to address a host of important issues with respect to concrete, such as degradation due to freeze-thaw cycling and chemical attack.

Hydroxyl (OH) is the atmosphere's primary oxidant. Comparisons of measurements and models provide evidence that OH and hydroperoxyl (HO2) chemistry is generally understood in clean, remote environments, but less well understood in cities when nitrogen oxide (NOx) levels are high. Other evidence indicates that OH is most poorly understood in low-NOx, high biogenic VOC (BVOC) environments, particularly forests where measured OH has greatly exceeded modeled OH by a factor of 2 to 10, well beyond the typical ?30% 2? uncertainties.<br/><br/>These forest environments are challenging the models, for which new oxidation mechanisms are being designed, and the measurements, which can have interferences and be near their detection limits. A previously suspected interference was recently confirmed for the combination of O3, OH, and alkenes in the Principal Investigator's (PI) laser-based Ground-based Hydrogen Oxides Sensor (GTHOS) by adding the ability to detect OH by chemical removal of OH (called OHchem) to the usual method wavelength modulation on and off an OH spectral line (called OHwave). Laboratory tests demonstrate that OHchem is the real OH for GTHOS.<br/><br/>This project will contribute measurements of OHchem, OHwave, HO2, alkene-based RO2, and OH reactivity to a multi-investigator study that will provide a consistent picture of the isoprene oxidation mechanism, demonstrate that OHchem is the real OH, and determine if the GTHOS OH interference is caused by an atmospherically relevant intermediate species. The PIs will also find the reason that GTHOS appears to be much more sensitive to this O3/OH/alkene interference than other OH-measuring instruments and to reduce that sensitivity if the interference is not atmospherically relevant. These goals of this two-year study will be accomplished primarily by participating with other groups who are proposing separately in a Focused Isoprene-chemistry eXperiment (FIX), which has a field component as part of the Secondary Organic Aerosol Study and a laboratory environmental chamber component.

Separated  representations, a natural extension of separation of variables,  is a nonlinear method to approximate multidimensional functions  as sums of separable functions. In this representation functions  in a high-dimensional space are described with a small number of  parameters, making possible to bypass the so-called curse of  dimensionality, that is, to avoid the exponential growth of  computational cost in the underlying dimension of the problem.  The term in functional form refers to the handling of the  components of separated representations in each dimension; they  are obtained via a nonlinear approximation rather than via a  representation through bases. This approach not only provides a  greater efficiency by reducing the number of parameters but also  expands the current paradigm for solving equations. By seeking  solutions via a self-correcting iterative process, a new  efficient algorithm keeps a manageable number of terms in the  representation while maintaining the functional form of the  components and the desired accuracy. The goal of this project is  to design, test and implement such a reduction algorithm and  apply it to solve several multidimensional problems that cannot  be addressed by current methods. Many problems in modern science  require computing multivariate solutions and a major challenge is  to develop representations and algorithms to obtain them while  avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The proposed effort  develops a functional calculus for solving high dimensional  problems via a self-correcting iterative process based on a  combination of three types of novel algorithms: (1) Separated representations in functional form as a tool to circumvent the curse of dimensionality; (2) Highly efficient nonlinear approximations of univariate functions to achieve adaptivity of the components of the separated representations; (3) Randomized projections to reduce the number of terms in the separated representation while maintaining the functional form of the components and the desired accuracy. These adaptive algorithms should yield accurate solutions with  guaranteed error bounds while requiring a computational time that scales linearly in the dimension of the problem. A particular emphasis of this proposal is on a fundamental problem of Quantum Chemistry to accurately compute the electronic structure of molecules.   <br/><br/>Accurate modeling in modern science and engineering requires  computations with multivariate functions and any progress toward  making such computations feasible will either significantly  accelerate existing numerical methods or lead to the solution of  many problems that are currently out of reach. Scientific areas  to benefit from proposed algorithms are not limited to Quantum  Chemistry and material sciences where the ability to understand  chemical reactions and properties of materials relies heavily on  efficient numerical algorithms, but also include robotics and the  design of multicomponent structures, just to name a few. This  proposal provides numerical tools to address the multivariate  nature of many challenging scientific problems. As a result, topics of the proposal are expected to give raise to  interdisciplinary collaborations as well as  become part of  graduate dissertations.","=""47.049""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Gregory Beylkin,"=""09/15/2013""",Boulder,Junping Wang,,US,"=""02""",Boulder,jwang@nsf.gov,University of Colorado at Boulder,"=""09/17/2013""",,"=""007431505""",(303) 492-6935

The ChemWiki is organized around a collaborative approach to chemistry education where an Open Access textbook is constantly being written and re-written, partly by students and partly by faculty, resulting in a no-fee, high-quality textbook, accessible anytime, anywhere, by anyone with internet access.  The ChemWiki is enabling Wikitexts to be created by individual faculty by ordering modular content in a way that is meeting localized needs, and is allowing other Core Modules to be modified via an embedded graphical editor, and then incorporated into the Wikitext.  The ever growing list of Wikitexts is available for anyone to peruse, adapt and adopt as needs dictate.  The ChemWiki is incorporating a separate application, the 'Student Ability Rating and Inquiry System' (SARIS) that is addressing the need for student practice, by incorporating an extensive question database augmented with links to the ChemWiki core material.  SARIS is providing quiz and homework questions, drawn from a deep pool, and is providing students with immediate formative feedback designed to enhance their problem-solving skills.<br/><br/>The ChemWiki is enabling student participatory learning by engaging them in the content construction.

Based on recent modeling efforts, there is reason to believe that stress induced dissolution is also a significant deformation mechanism in cementitious materials. Thus, there is an expected coupling between the evolution of chemistry, microstructure development, and stress and strain states within cementitious materials. A primary objective of this project is to develop a fundamental thermodynamic model framework that links evolving system chemistry and mechanics of cementitious materials, and to implement the model through a computational method that predicts the fully coupled evolution of microstructure and viscoelastic/viscoplastic properties of the materials. In synergy with the fundamental modeling, novel experiments using time-stepping micro-computed tomography of stressed specimens will be performed to test the hypothesis that stress induces dissolution in cementitious materials. The results of this project will lead to important advances in understanding the evolution of constitutive properties and the underlying deformation mechanisms; this will ultimately help enable design of concrete with greater strength, toughness, durability, and sustainability. <br/><br/>Concrete, the second most used commodity in the world, suffers from many structural and durability issues that result in substantial economic and environmental costs. The drawbacks of cementitious materials such as concrete may be attributed in part to design limitations associated with the lack of available modeling tools for effectively predicting the evolution of the material structure and properties. The results of this project will provide societal benefit by providing advanced modeling, experimental, and computational tools to help improve the economy, durability and sustainability of cementitious materials. Furthermore, other researchers will ultimately be able to freely implement the tools developed in this project to address a host of important issues with respect to concrete, such as degradation due to freeze-thaw cycling and chemical attack. A modeling approach that involves fundamental theory and coupling between chemistry and mechanical processes (such as deformation) has the capability to ultimately transform our understanding of the behavior of cementitious materials such as concrete.","=""47.041""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",K.

At the end of the 2000s, it has been shown that they can coordinate main group elements in their zero oxidation state, and even activate small molecules. We have found novel applications for carbenes. We have reported that they allow for the isolation of phosphorus-centered radicals, species that had been postulated as transient intermediates in several chemical reactions, but never structurally characterized. Phosphorus centered radicals are particularly interesting for spin-labeling experiments since the orientation dependence of the large hyperfine coupling with the phosphorus nucleus could provide detail concerned with much faster molecular movements than that available from the widely used nitroxides. Thanks to the stabilizing effect of carbenes, we have isolated a tricoordinated neutral boron derivative, which is isoelectronic with amines. In other words, in contrast to the usual boranes, which are prototypical Lewis acids, our new boron compound is a Lewis base, and a potential L ligand for transition metals. We have discovered the first nitrene, a nitrogen analogue of carbenes, which is stable at room temperature. This compound, namely a phosphinonitrene, has been fully characterized. It is related to transition metal nitrido complexes (metallonitrenes, LnMN), which have extensively been studied due to their implications in biological nitrogen fixation by the nitrogenase enzymes, and the industrial Haber-Bosch hydrogenation process of N2 into NH3. We have shown that the phosphinonitrene can as well act as a nitrogen atom transfer agent. Thanks to the presence of two p-accepting cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs), we have isolated the first complexes featuring one and two atoms of gold in the formal zero oxidation state. The preparation of these compounds constitutes the first step towards the synthesis of ultra-small gold nanoparticles, which have applications ranging from care diagnostics to advanced methods of controlled intracellular delivery.

This project will yield research-based (a) practices for the development of curricula that integrate concrete and virtual models as effective learning aids and (b) principles for the design of meaningful model-based instruction.<br/><br/>The proposed project has the potential to inform teachers and curriculum designers about how better to use models and other representations in chemistry and other highly spatial STEM domains (e.g., geology, astronomy, anatomy, and mechanical engineering), by contributing to our basic understanding of what cognitive and perceptual factors affect learning. The knowledge gained from this project will inform the effective design and delivery of new media made possible by the explosive growth in availability of smart-phones and tablets in the classroom. Finally, results of this project will inform our understanding of how gender and differences in spatial ability contributes to learning with models in STEM disciplines.","=""47.076""",490106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"=""4900""",Andrew T Stull,"=""09/01/2013""",Santa Barbara,Gregg E.

The overarching goal of the project is to provide chemistry instructors access to data warehouses of student performance on chemistry test items that can be queried to compare the performance of their students to the performance of the entire population in the database.  This work is leveraging long-standing capacity in comparative assessment within chemistry education, as provided through norm-referenced examinations produced by the American Chemical Society Examinations Institute, with software developers, whose expertise led to the creation of the Online Web-based Learning (OWL) system used by 200,000 students of chemistry.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Conducting psychometric research and developing semi-automated methods for instructors to align test items to a content criterion template are facilitating significant progress in both chemistry education and psychometrics.

Developing the requisite software tools advances understanding in several key areas, such as architecture for test item meta tags, efficiency of test data warehousing, user-friendly query tools for assessment development and effectual data organization and visualization in assessment outcomes reports for users.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This work is developing practical tools for chemistry instructors from all institution types to improve their marshaling of evidence with regard to student learning in chemistry.  As the database of student performance on assessments grows, data will permit for more complete and meaningful comparisons of the efficacy of curricular and pedagogical reforms.

The three-year project involves faculty and students in electrical engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln and in chemistry at University of Massachusetts Boston. The study is examining two courses in each discipline (that typically occur in the sophomore and junior years) for evidence of an abstraction threshold - the gap in reasoning ability that can be crossed by students. The project is seeking to characterize reasoning applied to problem solving using a cognitive processing model, Representation Mapping.<br/><br/>The study tests two hypotheses: <br/>1) Many students do not have fully mature processes for abstraction, i.e., cognitive supply, and it is possible to measure what their processes are and the degree to which they are capable of reasoning using abstraction. <br/>2) Somewhere in each undergraduate STEM curriculum, cognitive demand increases to the point where a typical students current capacity for abstraction is not matched to the complexity of problems posed, and this impacts student performance. <br/><br/>The research questions being studied are: <br/>RQ1: How can students problem solving processes and degree of abstraction in two different STEM disciplines - electrical engineering and chemistry - be characterized using Representation Mapping? <br/>RQ2: What evidence is there that abstraction thresholds exist in undergraduate electrical engineering and chemistry curricula? <br/>RQ3: What are discipline-specific nuances of abstraction in electrical engineering and chemistry education?<br/><br/>This theory-driven project involves a rigorous interdisciplinary study that has the potential to significantly advance the understanding of how students reason when solving problems associated with deep concepts in STEM disciplines. The effort is in direct alignment the report from the National Academies on Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER), which includes ""Interdisciplinary studies of cross-cutting concepts and cognitive processes"" as one of its four overall recommendations for promising directions in studying undergraduate STEM education. The project is making significant contributions to the knowledge base on how to increase students' problem solving approaches and is helping to uncover how domain-general and discipline-dependent cognitive processing interact in two STEM disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>BROADER SIGNIFICANCE <br/>As manifest by its strong alignment with the DBER report, the project is an area of national interest. The project is uncovering commonalities of abstraction in two STEM disciplines and clarifying differences in abstraction between the disciplines. This effort is providing fundamental insights to support how instructors can capitalize on commonalities and deliberately provide avenues for students to practice discipline-dependent reasoning strategies in problem solving. <br/><br/>Situating the data collection in two very different universities - a traditional research university in the Midwest and a majority minority non-traditional university in the Northeast - lends greater potential relevance to the findings, which is being widely disseminated at high profile conferences in both science and engineering education. An interdisciplinary study is producing results that are more readily transferred to other STEM disciplines, thus enhancing their potential for broad adoption.","=""47.076""",490106 NSF Education & Human Resource,"=""4900""",Lance C Perez,"=""09/01/2013""",Lincoln,Edith Gummer,,US,"=""01""",,egummer@nsf.gov,University of Nebraska-Lincoln,"=""09/03/2013""",,"=""555456995""",(402) 472-6258

As a conventional TEM the instrument will enhance the current electron microscopy capabilities in teaching, user training and research. The capability to visualize structural changes at the sub-nanoscale level under operational environmental conditions will bring essential insights to many materials issues, such as the effect of dopants and impurities on processing and corrosion, defect (dislocation, grain boundaries and interface) migrations, thermally induced phase transformations, heterogeneous catalyses, nano-scale functional materials, and the environmental stability of materials in general.  The low accelerating voltage minimizes damage of oxide species and soft materials, thereby providing the ability to visualize the dynamics of polymers, tissue engineering, drug delivery, biomaterials and biomineralization.  This will be the first ETEM in the greater Western Pennsylvania area.  It will be housed at the University of Pittsburgh in the Swanson School of Engineering (SSoE) and will be a part of the Nanofabrication and Characterization Facility (NFCF) in the Peterson Institute of NanoScience and Engineering (PINSE). It will be linked to the electron microscopy facility in the Structural Biology department, School of Medicine. The NFCF is a user facility available to all national and international researchers.  The broad visibility and access to this instrument will contribute to nano- and meso-scale science and technology, biology, energy and sustainability research and to the training of post-docs, graduate students and undergraduate students. This instrument will also be used in teaching courses in Electron Microscopy, Nano-characterization, Thin Films, Biomaterials, Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology.

Yang to correlate experimental studies with first principles theoretical simulations in developing a fundamental understanding of the structure/chemical property relationship of a prototypical system based on platinum/gamma-alumina (Pt/gamma-Al2O3).  Pt/gamma-Al2O3 is an important heterogeneous catalysts system used in oil refining, catalytic converters, and fuel cells.  While much is known about the system, a significant gap exists between experiment and theory because commercially-available gamma-alumina is polycrystalline with ill-defined morphologies, crystallography and impurities.  To bridge the gap, Yang's research group optimizes the oxidation conditions of single crystal nickel aluminum to produce reasonably flat, defect-free, single crystal gamma-Al2O3 films that are tens of nanometers thick (bulk-like).  The characterization of size, morphologies, facets, dispersion and interfaces as well as electronic and chemical states under gas environments is accomplished by using the cutting-edge facilities at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Direct comparison of the experimental data with theoretical modeling is accomplished through collaboration with Drs. Linlin Wang and Duane Johnson (Ames Laboratory and Iowa State University).

One method for mitigating CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is to capture CO2 from its sources and sequester it into the subsurface. However, if the stored CO2 reaches highly permeable conduits such as faults and fractures, CO2 could leak unabated to other formations or to the surface. The addressed eruptive mechanisms are analogues to natural CO2 eruption mechanisms, which are found in CO2-driven cold-water geysers around the world. In this project, phenomenological CO2 leakages from cold-water geysers, springs, and diffusive CO2 transport will be investigated by collecting continuous datasets of in-situ P, T, water chemistry (pH, EC, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved gas) adjacent to the Little Grand and Salt Wash fault systems in Utah. Specific project goals include (1) identification of the original CO2 sourcing and (2) the causes of cyclic patterns observed at cold-water geysers and diffusive soil CO2 flux. In addition, (3) the role of fault systems on these cold-water geysers and soil CO2 flux patterns will be investigated. Part I of the project specifically focuses on understanding the eruption characteristics of CO2-driven cold-water geysers (Crystal and Tenmile geysers). Part II focuses on characterizing the short (daily)- and long-term (month) variations of diffusive soil CO2 flux on the fault systems. In Part III, the numerical simulations will be conducted to validate the dynamic setting of CO2 eruption at the geysers and diffusive CO2 flux from soils. <br/><br/>The project involves societal issues of the importance of CO2 flux, which is considered to be the most critical component for global climate change and the carbon cycle. Understanding CO2-driven cold-water geyser eruptions will be important in the next decade for testing the feasibility of safe storage of the sequestered CO2. Specifically, the advanced understanding of thermophysical changes in cold-water geyser eruptions will help design the operational and reservoir conditions preventing the potential catastrophic CO2 leakage from the storage formation and develop the in-situ optimum sensors to track the subsurface CO2 plume migration at the engineered geologic CO2 storage site. Finally, scientific communities who study hot-water geyser eruption, the well blow-out processes in the petroleum field, and volcanology eruptions will be interested in finding similarities of eruption patterns/periods and the role of CO2.","=""47.050""",490100 NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,"=""4900""",Brian J McPherson,"=""04/01/2013""",Salt Lake City,Shemin Ge,,US,"=""02""",,sge@nsf.gov,University of Utah,"=""01/31/2013""",,"=""009095365""",(801) 581-5634
